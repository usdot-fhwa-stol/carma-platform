# frame_transformer

This package contains a node which supports semi-arbitrary coordinate transformations on data using the TF2 library. The node will setup a publisher and subscriber based on the ```message_type``` parameter which will convert the input data into the frame specified by the ```target_frame``` parameter if a transform is available on the tf2 transform tree and a known ```doTransform``` overload exists for that message type. This node is intended for use only in support of interoperability between nodes expecting input data known a priori. This node should be treated as a fallback and not as the default. When creating new nodes, users should still prefer to leverage the tf2 library directly as this increases the overall interoperability of those components with other ROS based systems.
