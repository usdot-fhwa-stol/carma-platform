# Double: Safety multiplier of planned allowable vehicle deceleration to use when stopping. This new deceleration makes vehicle decelerate earlier distance.
#         NOTE: Stacks on vehicle_decel_limit_multiplier and stopping uses max_decel; this distance is only used for calculating earlier downtrack
