# Development workflow

We follow the [Gitflow][gitflow_description] methodology for internal contributions and the [Forking workflow][forking_workflow_description] for external ones.
Internal developers are part of the [U.S. DOT FHWA STOL][usdot_fhwa_stol_github_org] GitHub organization, and external developers are everyone else.
