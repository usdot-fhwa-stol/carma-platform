# port_drayage_plugin

The Port Drayage Plugin is a ROS node within CARMA Platform that supports freight port drayage operations. It is responsible for handling all port drayage-related communication with V2X-Hub, and for facilitating interactions with other ROS nodes (primarily the route node) within CARMA Platform in order for the vehicle to execute port drayage operations successfully.
