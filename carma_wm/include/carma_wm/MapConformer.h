 * In addition, lanelets and areas are updated to have their accessability marked with a RegionAccessRule.
 * At the moment the creation of DigitalSpeedLimits for all lanelets/areas is not performed. This is because
 * CarmaUSTrafficRules supports the existing SpeedLimit definition and allows DigitalSpeedLimits to be overlayed on
