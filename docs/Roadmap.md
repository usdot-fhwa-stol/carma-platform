# CARMA Roadmap

*[Updated 10 Jan 2020]*

This page presents the current vision for future release activity of the CARMA platform.  It is focused on version 3 (CARMA3) since that is a major upgrade.
Beyond that we will definitely be pushing the system toward SAE level 4 autonomy while continuing to extend the sophistication of the V2x communication capabilities and resultant cooperative behavior.

Since this system is being developed in an agile environment, no precise schedule of future functionality exists.  However, the below presents what the development team expects at this time.  It is subject to change with each sprint.  Each of the relevant features tracked in our Jira backlog is represented in a separate row, grouped and color coded by feature group.
