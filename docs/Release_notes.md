Version 3.4.2, released December 15th, 2020
--------------------------------------------------------

**Summary:**
carma-platform rlease version 3.4.2 is a hotfix to update platform with the most recent version of carma-messenger (carma-messenger-1.0.2). The carma-messenger-1.0.2 release resolves a defect where version numbers were not populating in carma-messenger-ui.

Fixes in this release:

Third, carma-messenger was updated to detect nearby automated vehicles via DSRC. And fourth, functionality was added to carma-messenger to allow for requesting, receiving, and displaying truck safety info from a passing Carma truck via DSRC while vehicles are in motion. Along with the above enhancements, several bug fixes and CI related enhancements are included in this release.

Enhancements in this release:

The converter currently only covers lane geometry only. Autoware v1.13 pre-release has been integrated with CARMAPlatform. A guidance plan delegator has been developed to notify strategic plugins that the arbitrator has selected their maneuver plan, and request the corresponding trajectory plan for said plugin.

Pre-Release Version 3.0.0, released 15 July 2019 
----------------------------------- 

**Summary:**
CARMAPlatform pre-release version 3.0.0 is the first step to integrating Autoware and its components, specifically NDT matching and pure pursuit. CARMAPlatform now includes both lateral (steering) control and longitudinal (speed) control for full SAE level 2 autonomy. GNSS initialization of NDT matching has been added in order to localize the vehicle’s position on the 3D Point Cloud Map with LiDAR scan.  A temporary UI integration has been included for minimum viable functionality while awaiting further development of CARMA guidance node. Other highlights of this release are the new drivers (e.g. Velodyne LiDAR, Novatel GPS), conforming to the new CARMA3 API, Docker updates, and adding code coverage metrics to Sonar Cloud.

Version 2.7.2, released 17 July 2018
------------------------------------

This is the first public release of the CARMA platform (internally known as Prototype I).

Installation must be performed from a development computer.  Once the system is built 
locally on that computer, the remote installer tool, found in the engineering_tools 
directory, can be run to transfer the executable and configuration files to the target 
vehicle computer in a directory named /opt/carma. Please see the User Guide in the docs
folder for more details.

Operating the software requires that it is installed in a properly modified vehicle, with
corresponding device drivers in place.  Use at FHWA Saxton Lab is on customized Cadillac SRX, 
Ford Escape and Freightliner Cascadia truck.
