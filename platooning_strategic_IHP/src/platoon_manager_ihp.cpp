     * Implementation notes:  
     * 
     * 1. platoon vector indexing: 
     *  A vector of platoon members (vehicles), sorted by downtrack distance in descending order (i.e., [dtd_1 > dtd_2 > ... > dtd_n] ). 
     * 
     * 2. speed vector indexing: 
     *  A vector that only contains speed (m/s) of each platoon member. Same order with platoon list (i.e., [platoon_front, follwer_1, ..., follower_n]).
     * 
     * 3. downtrackDistance vector indexing:
     *  A vector that only contains downtrack distance (m) of each platoon member. Same order with platoon list (i.e., [platoon_front, follwer_1, ..., follower_n])
     * 
     * 4. timeHeadway vector indexing 
     *  A vector that only contains time headaway (s) behind each platoon member (i.e., the time gap between host vehicle and its following vehicle). 
     *  Same order with platoon list. For APF, when gap too small, the dynamic leader will be the front vehicle of the small gap. If gap too large, the dynamic leader 
     *  wil be the rear vehicle of the large gap.
